## A fluid and mobile friendly navigation concept by Niklaus Gerber
«NavLax» is my take on the beautiful navigation concept of the Teehan+Lax (http://www.teehanlax.com) agency website. It has been built to be fluid responsive and to work with ease on any mobile device with or without retina screen. The grid and the Flat-UI components are taken from my [«Rapid Bootstrap»](https://github.com/niklausgerber/Rapid-Bootstrap "Rapid Bootstrap"). Please feel free to send me a link if you implemented it into one of your projects.
